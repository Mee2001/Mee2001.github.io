description: "First year university project, designing and simulating an analog synthesizer. <br>The purpose of the analog synthesiser is to create sound electronically using analog circuits. This is accomplished through various stages, or blocks of circuits which interconnect in order to create a working product. Starting at the input, the keyboard, which creates the signal to generate the tone. This then passes through oscillator blocks to create the waveform and change the sound and then through filters to remove/subdue certain frequencies of the synthesiser. Finally this reaches the output which is amplified and sent to an output device to be recorded or played through speakers. <br> For more details, [get in touch](mailto:vs419@ic.ac.uk)."
